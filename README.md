# AutomationExercise

## Instructions to use the skeleton solution.

1. The base solution contains some implementations that might require to complete the exercise
2. Use the base solution as your starting point. If you think the base framework can be improved, feel free to improve it or make suggestions.
3. Use Visual Studio(2017 or 2019), C#, and Specflow to complete the exercise. SpecRun is used in the solution as the test runner.
4. Automate the scenario in such a way that, it's easy to extend and reuse your code in the future.
5. Use Chrome as the browser.
6. Clearly mention any assumptions made during your implementation, suggestions to improve and problems encountered in your reply.
7. Make sure the solution can be compiled and tests can be executed successfully before your final commit.
8. The base solution has been configured to generate a report after the automated test execution (TestSummaryReport.html). ZIP and send us your final test execution report.
9. The solution has been configured to use chrome driver version 78.0.3904.70. If you have a newer version of Chrome browser, you have to update the chrome driver accordingly.

Thank you for taking the time to complete the exercise and Good Luck!
